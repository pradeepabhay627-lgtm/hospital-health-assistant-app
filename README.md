# HealthConnect – Hospital Booking & Personal Health Assistant (Concept Project)

## 🔹 TL;DR (Short Summary)
HealthConnect is a simple open-source **idea project** for a future health app.  
It helps people book hospital appointments, store basic medical history, get personalised reminders, and manage insurance details — all in one place.  
This repo is only the concept and documentation, so it can be built in the future.

## 🔹 What is this project?
HealthConnect is a concept for a health-related mobile app that aims to make hospital visits easier for everyone.  
It brings together **hospital booking**, **personal health records**, **reminders**, and **insurance details** in a single simple app.

This project is currently in the *idea stage* — no full code yet.  
The goal is to share the idea, get feedback, and develop it in the future.

## 🔹 Why this idea?
People often face:
- Long queues in government and private hospitals  
- Forgetting follow-up dates  
- Losing old prescriptions  
- Not knowing which hospitals accept their insurance  
- Repeating the same details at every visit  

HealthConnect tries to solve these everyday problems with one app.
